# Getting Started with Create React App

My first react application that allows user to add items to collection, filter and search it. 
It does not save the data as my goal was to only focus on improving my frontend skills in React.
Inital data is loaded from json file.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts
To start type in console:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
